# Arbitrager

A simple algorithm that will take in standard input of vectors of different forex pairs, 
and output if there are any arbitrage opportunities.

- Bellman ford algorithm?
- Floyd warshall? -> perhaps measure speed for graphs of different sizes
- Dijkstra modification?

Maybe in the future, we can optimize it to work on a changing stock market, perhaps
with delta updates.
